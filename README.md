**(Also in the project there is a docker-compose.yml file that you can use to run this project with docker)**

**TL;DR command list**

```
git clone git@github.com:USER/PROJECT-NAME.git
cd PROJECT-NAME
composer install || composer update
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate
php artisan migrate
php artisan serve
```

**Make sure you set the correct database connection information before running the migrations**

```
php artisan migrate
php artisan serve
```

## Database seeding

**Populate the database with seed data with relationships. This can help you to quickly start testing using it with ready content.**

Open the DatabaseSeeder and set the property values as per your requirement

```
database/seeds/DatabaseSeeder.php
```

Run the database seeder and you're done

```
php artisan db:seed
```

***Note*** : It's recommended to have a clean database before seeding. You can refresh your migrations at any point to clean the database by running the following command

```
php artisan migrate:refresh
```

## Testing

You can run tests via phpunit

```
/vendor/bin/phpunit tests/Unit
```

In addition to the phpunit command, you may use the test Artisan command to run your tests. The Artisan test runner provides more information regarding the test that is currently running and will automatically stop on the first test failure

```
php artisan test
```
